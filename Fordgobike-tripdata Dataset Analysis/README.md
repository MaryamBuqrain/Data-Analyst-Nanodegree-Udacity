# (Gobike sharing system Exploration )

## Dataset
The data consists of information regarding approximately 183412 trips made in a bike-sharing system covering the San Francisco Bay area. Which they described by 16 features including duration, customer type, and gender, as well as additional variables such as member's year of birth, start and end station name, start and end station longitude, and latitude. The dataset can be found in the


## Summary of Findings

 I noted that the average trip length is 12 minutes or 600 seconds, and the majority of the trips occur on Thursdays and Tuesdays. On weekends, there are fewer trips, but they last longer than on other weekdays. One interesting thing I also found is the higher trip starts at 8 AM  in the morning and 17 PM hours in the evening. This can be related to the rush during the two periods of the day. Most of the rides were taken by subscribers and over 70% of the total rides were taken by the male gender.

According to my analysis, normal customers spend a lot more time on their trips than subscribers, and females tend to ride for a longer period of time than males. Also, Most biking users are younger people, they are between 25 to 60, but also there is a good amount of older people who use bikes These people are the outliers in Age in the dataset such as 140 years. 

User type seems to impact the number of rides over weeks and affect the duration. For example for any given day, customer user type tends to spend longer duration on their trips as compared to subscribers.


## Key Insights for Presentation

For the presentation, I focus on just the user behavior and how age, duration, hours, and days of trips differ for each user. I start by finding the majority of users types, followed by their information like age, then plot the pattern of duration usage for each type of user over weekdays and weekends in minutes 
Afterward, I showed the Peak time for riding bikes using barplot to find out when is the peak time for each type of user. In the end there are limitations like missing data or data that not collocted in the first place so we need more to get more insights
